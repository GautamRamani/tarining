What is TypeScript and why it is used?

        TypeScript extends JavaScript, providing a better developer experience. The benefits of using TypeScript over JavaScript include: Static typing â€“ TypeScript comes with optional static typing and a type inference system, which means that a variable, declared with no type may be inferred by TypeScript based on its value.

                        c c++ Java

                                int number =10;
                                number="a"  not possible

        Dynamically Type:-

                        Javascript python Ruby

                        let number =10
                        number ="a"    

        TypeScript --->Javascript with type Checking

        browser does not understand Type script we are using typescript compiler

        typescript:-  Medium to large Project
        Javascript:- Simple project


        command:-

                npm i -g typescript
                tsc.cmd -v     -->show version
                tsc.cmd --init

                simple create file index.ts
                run cmd--> tsc index.ts it will create index.js file
                 

        JavaScript Data Type:-          TypeScript Data Type:-

        number                          any
        string                          unknown
        bollean                         never
        null                            enum
        undefined                       tupal
        object
        
        Type Script has Three Access Specifier Public,Private,Protected
        
        Public:- Member function can be accesse with in the class as well outside the class
        Private:- Member function can only access within the class
        Protected:- Similar to the Private..access within the Diffrence is the Private does not access in child class
                        but Protected is access in child class  

        Inheritance:-
                Parent/Base/Super
                Child/Derived/sub

flow :-

        npm i -g typescript
        tsc.cmd -v     -->show version
        tsc.cmd --init ->create tsconfig.json

        Make change in tsconfig.json
        /* Modules */

         "rootDir": "./src" 
        
        /* Emit */
        
        "outDir": "./dist"
        
        create index.ts file in src folder

        run 

        tsc        -->it will create index.js file in dist folder   
        
        run in cmd

        tsc && node dist/first.js
