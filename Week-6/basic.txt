Adapter:-

    An Adapter is a server-side component which is responsible for broadcasting events to all or a subset of clients.

    When scaling to multiple Socket.IO servers, you will need to replace the default in-memory adapter by another implementation, so the events are properly routed to all clients.

Emitter:-

    Most adapter implementations come with their associated emitter package, which allows communicating to the group of Socket.IO servers from another Node.js process.

Namespace:-

    A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing").
