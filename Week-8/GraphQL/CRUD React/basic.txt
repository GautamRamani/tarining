    Apolo Server:-

        Apollo Server is an open-source, spec-compliant GraphQL server that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including Apollo Client. It's the best way to build a production-ready, self-documenting GraphQL API that can use data from any source.

First Start backend side server:-

                                npx nodemon index.js

After Start React server:-

                                cd client
                                npm start
